# Background
In this scenario, you’re a growth analyst at Mercado Libre. With over 200 million users, Mercado Libre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. You've been tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to help the company grow.
In a bid to drive revenue, you’ll produce a Jupyter notebook that contains your data preparation, your analysis, and your visualizations for all the time series data that the company needs to understand. You’ll use text and comments to document your findings. And, you’ll answer the question prompts in the instructions. Specifically, this notebook should contain the following:


Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.


An evaluation of how the company stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.


A Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.


Answers to the questions in the instructions that you write in your Jupyter notebook.


(Optional) A plot of a forecast for the company’s future revenue.


When you finish, you’ll push your final notebook to your GitHub repository so that others can review your work.
You’ll gain proficiency in the following tasks:


Identifying patterns in time series data.


Mining for patterns in seasonality by using visualizations.


Building sales-forecast and user-interest predictive models.
